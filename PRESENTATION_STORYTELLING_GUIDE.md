## 🎯 **Audience Engagement Techniques**

### 🗣️ **Vocal Delivery for Big Audiences**

#### **Pace Changes:**
- **Slow down for impact**: Numbers, key learnings, emotional moments
- **Speed up for urgency**: During the incident timeline escalation
- **Normal pace**: For explanatory content

#### **Pause Power:**
- After revealing impact numbers (1.56%, 5,420 users)
- Before major plot points ("Then, 3 minutes later...")
- During transitions between slides

#### **Volume Variation:**
- **Whisper for tension**: "Nobody was watching the alerts..."
- **Project for resolution**: "This is how we prevented it from happening again"
- **Normal for content**: Background and process information

### 👥 **Interactive Elements**

#### **Rhetorical Questions:**
- "How many of you have deployed on a Monday?"
- "Who here has been confident about a change, only to have it surprise you?"
- "What would you do if you got a Rollbar alert at 10:18 AM?"

#### **Show of Hands:**
- "Who here has been on-call during an incident?"
- "How many have been the incident commander?"
- "Who's had to calculate incident impact under pressure?"

#### **Shared Experience:**
- "We've all been there - the deploy that seemed perfect..."
- "Every engineer knows that sinking feeling when alerts start firing"
- "You know that moment when you realize the scope is bigger than you thought"

## 📊 **Visual Storytelling Strategy**

### 🎬 **Using Your Presentation Features**

#### **Fragment Animations (Timeline):**
- Each timeline event builds suspense
- Don't rush - let each moment land
- Use auto-scroll to guide audience attention

#### **Impact Calculation Reveal:**
- Build up to the 1.56% calculation
- Show the RQL query first (technical credibility)
- Reveal the final number with dramatic pause

#### **Image Lightbox:**
- "Let me show you what we actually saw..."
- Click to enlarge for dramatic effect
- Use images as evidence, not decoration

### 📈 **Data Storytelling:**
- **Numbers tell the story**: 5,420 affected users isn't just data - it's people
- **Timeline creates tension**: 3 minutes vs 7 hours vs next day
- **Process shows professionalism**: Your methodical response builds confidence

### 👏 **Team Recognition Strategy:**
- **Highlight individual contributions**: Call out specific team members who made a difference
- **Show collaboration tools**: Visual evidence of teamwork (like Marcel's Figma board)
- **Make heroes of helpers**: Transform incident stress into stories of people stepping up
- **Build team culture**: Recognition during presentations reinforces positive behaviors
- **Interactive recognition**: Let audience explore the actual tools used (Figma board link)
