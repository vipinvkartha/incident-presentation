**Your Hook**: *"What happens when a single line of code affects thousands of users in just 15 minutes?"*

- **Start with impact**: "1.56% of our daily active users - that's 5,420 people - couldn't access our platform"
- **Personal connection**: "I was the incident commander, and this is our story"
- **Promise value**: "Today, you'll learn exactly what happened, how we responded, and what we're doing to prevent this"

#### Technique:
- Start with the end result to grab attention
- Make it personal - you lived through this
- Set clear expectations for value

### üéØ **2. The Setup: Building Context (Background)**

**Narrative Frame**: *"Every good story starts with good intentions..."*

#### Story Elements:
- **The noble goal**: "We wanted to improve user experience with session management"
- **The business need**: "A major B2B client requested single sign-out"
- **The technical solution**: Show the code change as a "simple" improvement
- **Foreshadowing**: "What seemed like a straightforward change would soon test our entire incident response"

#### Delivery Tips:
- Use positive language to build the "before" picture
- Make the audience relate to the good intentions

- "Deployment successful. Coffee in hand. Everything looked perfect."

#### **4b. The First Sign (10:18 AM)**
- **Pause dramatically**: "Then, 3 minutes later..."
- "Rollbar alert. But here's the thing - nobody was watching."

#### **4d. The Revelation (Next Day)**
- "By the time we knew, thousands of users had already been affected"

### Timeline Delivery Strategy:
1. **Use your fragment animations** - let each event build suspense
2. **Vary your pacing** - slow for impact, fast for urgency
3. **Pause at key moments** - let the weight of each event sink in
4. **Show your images** - they're your visual evidence

## üéØ **Audience Engagement Techniques**

### üó£Ô∏è **Vocal Delivery for Big Audiences**

#### **Pace Changes:**
- **Slow down for impact**: Numbers, key learnings, emotional moments
- **Speed up for urgency**: During the incident timeline escalation
- **Normal pace**: For explanatory content

#### **Pause Power:**
- After revealing impact numbers (1.56%, 5,420 users)
- Before major plot points ("Then, 3 minutes later...")
- During transitions between slides

#### **Volume Variation:**
- **Whisper for tension**: "Nobody was watching the alerts..."
- **Project for resolution**: "This is how we prevented it from happening again"
- **Normal for content**: Background and process information

### üë• **Interactive Elements**

#### **Rhetorical Questions:**
- "How many of you have deployed on a Monday?"
- "Who here has been confident about a change, only to have it surprise you?"
- "What would you do if you got a Rollbar alert at 10:18 AM?"

#### **Show of Hands:**
- "Who here has been on-call during an incident?"
- "How many have been the incident commander?"
- "Who's had to calculate incident impact under pressure?"

#### **Shared Experience:**
- "We've all been there - the deploy that seemed perfect..."
- "Every engineer knows that sinking feeling when alerts start firing"
- "You know that moment when you realize the scope is bigger than you thought"

## üìä **Visual Storytelling Strategy**

### üé¨ **Using Your Presentation Features**

#### **Fragment Animations (Timeline):**
- Each timeline event builds suspense
- Don't rush - let each moment land
- Use auto-scroll to guide audience attention

#### **Impact Calculation Reveal:**
- Build up to the 1.56% calculation
- Show the RQL query first (technical credibility)
- Reveal the final number with dramatic pause

#### **Image Lightbox:**
- "Let me show you what we actually saw..."
- Click to enlarge for dramatic effect
- Use images as evidence, not decoration

### üìà **Data Storytelling:**
- **Numbers tell the story**: 5,420 affected users isn't just data - it's people
- **Timeline creates tension**: 3 minutes vs 7 hours vs next day
- **Process shows professionalism**: Your methodical response builds confidence

### üëè **Team Recognition Strategy:**
- **Highlight individual contributions**: Call out specific team members who made a difference
- **Show collaboration tools**: Visual evidence of teamwork (like Marcel's Figma board)
- **Make heroes of helpers**: Transform incident stress into stories of people stepping up
- **Build team culture**: Recognition during presentations reinforces positive behaviors
- **Interactive recognition**: Let audience explore the actual tools used (Figma board link)

#### **Visual Connection:**
- **Make eye contact across the room** - left, center, right, back
- **Use gestures visible from back** - larger than normal
- **Move purposefully** - not nervously

#### **Body Language:**

4. **Crisis** (6 minutes): The timeline with dramatic pacing
5. **Response** (3 minutes): Leadership under pressure
6. **Learning** (3 minutes): What we built from this
7. **Community** (2+ minutes): Q&A setup

#### **Pacing Control:**
- **Practice with actual slides** - know your transitions
